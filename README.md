## Introduction
This project is a **Bus Booking System** developed using **Python Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **SQLite** for the database. The application allows users to manage buses, routes, and operators, book tickets, and view booked seats.

It's a great learning project to understand how GUIs work in Python and how to integrate them with databases for real-world applications.

## Features
- **User-friendly GUI** for managing buses, operators, routes, and bookings.
- **Database-backed storage** using SQLite for storing bus schedules, routes, operators, and booking information.
- **Ticket booking functionality**, including viewing and managing seat availability.
- **Separate admin interface** for adding new buses, routes, and operators.
- **Interactive front page** and smooth navigation between screens.



## Usage
### Running the Application:
1. **Homepage**: Run `frontpage_first_screeen_open_this.py` to access the homepage.
2. **Admin Panel**: Use `admin_use.py` to manage buses, routes, and operators.
3. **Book a Bus**: Run `bookbus.py` to start booking tickets.
4. **View Booked Seats**: Use `checkbookseat.py` to check seat availability.
5. **Other Modules**:
   - `newbus.py` – Add a new bus to the database.
   - `newop.py` – Add a new operator.
   - `newroute.py` – Add new routes.
   - `newrun.py` – Manage bus runs.

### Admin Functions:
- Add, delete, or update buses, routes, and operators.
- Manage bus schedules and track routes.

### User Functions:
- Book bus tickets by selecting routes and available seats.
- View seat availability for a selected bus.
